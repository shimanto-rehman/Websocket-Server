# Node.js WebSocket Broadcast
## Used for Flutter Wifi Talks App

### About
This is the `node.js` server that creates a websocket from the `ws` npm packages. This WebSocket is used for a Flutter application. The app makes it possible to chat on a LAN. 

### Structure
2 main files in the `app` folder:
* `server.js` is used to run the websocket and to listen for incoming connections.
* `client.js` is a client that connects to the `server.js` websocket.
  * An automatic message is sent whenever there is an succesful connection with the websocket.


### How to Run
1. `git clone` this repo
2. `cd` into the `websocket-server` folder
3. Run `npm install` in command line
4. Open `app/config/config.js` and fill in your IP and port where the WebSocket should be running
4. Open `app/client.js`
5. Run `npm start`, this will execute the command `nodemon ./app/server.js`. Now your WebSocket is running
6. Run `npm run client ./app/client.js` to establish a connection and send a message 

**Notes:**
* It is possible to change the websocket port in the `server.js` file.
* You can find your IP by opening your terminal and type `ipconfig -all` and look for your IPv4 Address.
